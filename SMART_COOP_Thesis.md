## Abstract
The proponents examined the existing operations of Paltok (SFM) Credit Cooperative and identified significant inefficiencies in managing online transactions and verifying member-submitted documents. Although the cooperative utilizes a FoxPro-based local accounting system for walk-in transactions, the system is limited to on-site use and cannot process online submissions.

As a result, members submit proof of payments, deposits, and loan applications through Facebook Messenger, email, and personal employee accounts, leading to disorganized records, verification delays, and increased workload for accounting staff.

To address these challenges, the proponents developed **SMART COOP: A Transaction and Loan Management System with AI-Powered Document Enhancement**. The proposed web-based system centralizes online member transactions into a secure platform where members can upload and track submissions. Integrated Artificial Intelligence enhances uploaded documents to improve clarity and verification accuracy.

Overall, the system aims to streamline cooperative operations, reduce manual errors, improve processing time, and strengthen transparency and accountability across digital financial transactions.
